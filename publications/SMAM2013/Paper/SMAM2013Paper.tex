\begin{abstract}
In this paper we shall document how the MusicBrainz dataset, under the
Next Generation Schema and making use of extensible Advanced
Relationships, can be mapped to RDF using R2RML. We shall further
document how interlinkage is achieved to make this a bona fide
contribution to Linked Open Data. We shall document the mappings and
their execution and exposure of resulting data, and the use of further
tools to increase the interlinkage achieved. Since MusicBrainz is a
constantly evolving model, this will serve as documentation on how to
include further Advanced Relationships, including those yet to be
defined. This work also serves as one of the largest case studies in
the use of R2RML that has existed to date.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:Introduction}
A vision of MusicBrainz as a rich Semantic Web resource is a
long-standing one~\cite{DBLP:journals/expert/Swartz02}. In reality,
however, MusicBrainz has had a chequered history with Semantic
Technologies. In its early days the tool support for semantics were
not well-developed and the project backed off to a large degree. In
the intervening years, the relational database dumps were turned into
RDF using the D2RQ tool as part of the DBtune
project\footnote{\url{http://dbtune.org/}} at Queen Mary University of
London, and the Zitgist
viewer\footnote{\url{http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/wiki/Zitgist}}. More
recently, MusicBrainz
